Project Ideas, Resources, and discussions

Peace Family! My name is McKinley Jeter. I am making a pivot from social work to tech, and have chose to start learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At some point on journey, I will focus on learning Python as well. My goal is to become a beast at front-end web development and web design.
